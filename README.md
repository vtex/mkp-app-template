# App Template

The integration template app is a pre-built VTEX IO app developed by VTEX's Connections team for our partners, aiming to reduce development and implementation time when integrating with external marketplaces.

To learn more about the template and how to get started, check out the [documentation available in our integration guides](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/external-marketplace-integration-app-template). Furthermore, if you're interested in using tools to simplify development of integrations with VTEX's platform, take a look at the documentation of some of our other services, such as Channel Order API, for [integrating](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/external-marketplace-integration-collect-orders) and [updating](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/external-marketplace-update-order-status) order's status; and [Marketplace Category Mapper](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/external-marketplace-integration-catalog-mapping), for categories and attributes tree mapping.
